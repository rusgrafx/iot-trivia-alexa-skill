# Alexa skill: IoT Trivia

This repo contains a Node.js Lambda function for an Alexa Skill that was written circa 2014. 

It was the time when Amazon just announced Alexa, and they allowed third-party developers to create custom skills for it.

The skill implements a simple trivia mechanism, asking questions related to different IoT technologies and protocols, giving the user four possible options to respond with.

**Warning**: This skill is here just for archiving purposes. 
A lot has changed in Alexa's architecture since this skill was published initially, so it may no longer work as is.
